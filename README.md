This program will hit every entry in the MovieDB database and pull the ID number,
Title, and Plot Summary from every valid entry. It then outputs the data into a
csv file.

To use this you will need an API key from MovieDB. You will also need to create
a csv file to drop all the data into. If you plan on pulling anything other than
the ID number, the Title, and the Plot Summary from MovieDB, you will need to 
modify the code in several places.
